                <p>
                    Welcome one and all! This is my first large complex project that I started and finished. I am happy to annouce that I have learned 
                    HTML: 5 and CSS. Maybe not in the correct format for the average front-end developer but I believe that will come
                    with time and experience. The reason as to why I started this project is to get my feet on the ground
                    to start coding projects outside of my academics. Although the method for this project seems pretty straight forward for the average coder, to me this is a new realm that I haven't 
                    ever tried before. I am not saying that I don't know the start or how to do web design, it's just I haven't had the project that 
                    I deemed necessary to learn HTML and CSS. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways on to the process! I first started with a couple of drawings of what I wanted my website to look like on the big screen. These 
                    designs were inspired by three main websites which were all designed by software developers. The first is Timmy O'Mahony in which I was loved the 
                    simple design of his website. The second and third is by Francis Masangcay and David Gutierrez.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I will have to admit that two of these websites were created by my friends and some of my pages have the same layout as my friends.
                    When I started designing my website I first put the majority of my elements on the side of my website and when I 
                    moved my screen from the side and I realize that my elements don't move when the screen moves (this is still an issue with the website 
                    when the screen size becomes smaller). Afterwards, I scraped that design and made to my new and current design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I hope that you continue to explore my website and also email me any suggestions so that I can continue to grow and become a 
                    better frontend developer.
                </p>
