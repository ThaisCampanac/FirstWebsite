                    Although this project isn't originally a personal project, I do believe that I have added more features 
                    than what the original assignment entailed that it is considered as a personal project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original project asked for the student to test six sorting algorithms based on movement and comparasions, but 
                    I added time and memory as another element to test these algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first part of the program that was completed with the implementation of how to create the different types of lists: in order, reverse order, almost in order, and random order and ask the user to input which list they wish to create and the size of that list. For the in order list, I created a list that starts at 0 and ends at the size of the list minus one. Reverse order list was created in a similar fashion as the in order list, however the list started at the size of the array to one. For the almost in order list, I did the same as in order list but then selected 20% of  the list to become randomized. Lastly, random list was randomly selected. Next, I asked the user to input which algorithm they wish to test then the program would execute that algorithm. I then took all probes back into my main class in order to analysis the winning algorithm as defined above. Afterwards I had to reset the lists and objects from other classes in order to allow to user to reuse them. However, the list will not be reset until the user asks to create another list. Lastly, I implemented a GUI into my program with one additional probe in order to better understand my program. I, later on, conducted multiple tests and started to improve upon the efficiency of sorting lists with my best algorithm class.

                <p>
                    Lastly I would like to explain what was added freatures that wasn't a part of the original project which was added probes to the algorithms, 
                    the GUI, and the best algorithm feature.
