                <p>
                    Hello, I would like to say that this is my first separate project that I did on my own time. As my first,
                    I would like to state how proud I am to begin my personal projects journey. I would like to inform that this 
                    project was given to me as a challenge to see if I have the capabilities to research and code a program 
                    based on my research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start off, I would like to take some time and talk about the problem itself. Given a genbank(.gb) file, I was
                     suppose to make a circular diagram that shows both the features and the DNA strands of that particular genome and 
                     then output the file into a PNG.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I first saw the problem, I thought to myself that I could teach myself the technical background of how to 
                    read a .gb file and translate the information into a Genome Diagram. After a couple days of research and learning,
                    I still had a hard time comprehending how I would hard code this entire project, so I decided for the second best option
                    which was finding a library or libraries that would do the harx work for me. This is when I stumbled upon a library called
                    GenomeDiagram. Through even more research I realized that this library is now a part of a larger library called 
                    BioPython.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without these libraries, I don't know if with my current technical capabilities I would have been able to do this coding challenge.
                    The reason as to why I would say that was because I didn't realize the amount of work it would have become to parse and then separate
                    all the information and then make that into a genome diagram. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Either way, with the BioPython library, I was able the parse the information from the genbank into a record and then take the DNA segments
                     and features to create the final product of a PNG file.
                </p>
